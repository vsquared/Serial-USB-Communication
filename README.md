# Serial-USB-Communication
The following source code demonstrates USB serial communication with an Arduino board (UNO) by combining legacy C code for serial port connection with Objective-C for the MacOS interface.  Threading is employed to simultaneously print and plot data values.  An Arduino sketch that may be used for testing is included at the bottom of the source code.
